## YouTube and Facebook videos direct into Yelp pages.


### How this chrome extension works

##### YouTube:
We extract business' geolocation getting a Yelp page's metadata inserted into HTML and with this information we fetch (up to 50) YouTube videos geotagged nearby (250 meters). Very simple and useful. 

##### Facebook (BONUS)
Or in Facebook case, we search for a page using the Facebook's Graph API. If we find a page, we fetch all videos from it.

##### Caveats:
* YouTube isn't used so much to rate or share experiences in a place! It's result is not precise.
* To see Facebook videos, you need to authenticate through the extension's options button.
* The Facebook application created to this project isn't approved yet (it's sandboxed). Just authorized users can log into it. If you want to try it out, let me know via [estevao.lucas@gmail.com](estevao.lucas@gmail.com).

All new elements added into the page via extension are following the [Yelp's style guide](https://www.yelp.com.br/styleguide) and [icons](https://www.yelp.com/styleguide/icons).

You can use arrow keys to navigate between videos. Use esc key to close the video.

To see the extension running, just install it through [the extension page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vyelp/lleibkhjpnlieccdncckoedbfodklndm?hl=en-US&gl=BR)

### Requirements to build

[**NPM**](https://www.npmjs.com/) is needed to install all dependencies.

If was found some video near the business address, will appear a box below the map and images thubnail block.

Inside the `/src/inject.js` file we have the all the JS (with ES6 via Babel) code to run the plugin.

Run `$ gulp watch` or `$ gulp build` to compile the file.

PS: Everytime you update anything on this project you need to update/reload the package extension too. To do that, you just need to click on **Realod** button in Vyelp item on Extension page".
